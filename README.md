Game is played by using the mouse to move the paddle. Bounce the ball off the paddle so that it collides with the bubbles. If the ball's color matches the bubble's, the bubble will pop. Pop all bubbles to advance to the next level. Make it through five levels to win. Miss the ball three times in the same level to lose. Click the mouse anywhere to start.
